# User input

Here is an example of how to take user input in a Rust program:

```rust
  use std::io;
  
  fn main() {
      let mut input = String::new();
  
      io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
  
      println!("The user input is: {}", input);
  }
```    

In this example, the `read_line()` function from the `std::io` module is used to read a line of user input. The `read_line()` function takes a mutable string as an argument, and it returns an `io::Result`. The `io::Result` enum represents the result of an I/O operation, and it can either be `Ok` or `Err`.

If the `read_line()` function succeeds, it returns `Ok(input)`, where `input` is the string that was entered by the user. If the `read_line()` function fails, it returns `Err(error)`, where `error` is an error message.

The `expect()` macro is used to handle the `io::Result` from the `read_line()` function. The `expect()` macro takes a `Result` as an argument, and it panics if the `Result` is `Err`. In this example, the `expect()` macro will panic if the `read_line()` function fails.

The `main()` function prints the user input to the console.

Here is an example of how to run the program:

Code snippet
    
  ```shell
  cargo run
 ```

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter some text. After you enter the text, the program will print the text that you entered to the console.

To capture user input in a Rust program, you can use the `std::io` module to read input from the standard input stream (`stdin`). Here's an example that demonstrates how to get user input in Rust:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Please enter your name:");

    let mut name = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut name)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("Hello, {}!", name.trim());
}
```

In this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name. It creates a mutable `String` variable called `name` to store the input. The `read_line` function from `std::io::stdin()` reads the input from the user and appends it to the `name` variable. The `expect` method is used to handle any errors that may occur during input reading.

Finally, the program trims the input using the `trim` method to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. It then prints a greeting message along with the user's name.

You can run this program and interact with it by providing your name as input.
