# First of all

Relax. Clean up around you, and pet your mouse. Then make sure that you have your Mac fixed (I'm assuming **you're using macOS**, for other operating systems ask your friend for a advice how to tackle your challenges, as I'm not going to cover Windows, only **GNU/Linux server** running in contenerized applications). I'm using secondhand MacBook Air from 2013, and it's doing well, I hope you can find yourself a better one for the same price (although it might still be only _Intel-based_), or raise the stake higher, do yourself a favour and buy a new _M1/M2 Apple Silicon_. If you're on a budget, then go for _Mac Mini with M2 Apple Silicon_ (still you need to buy a display, keyboard and mouse).
