# Prerequisites

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - used for installing unofficial packages and apps for macOS
* Internet connection - better not metered, as we might surpass the download limit
* Time - never enough
* Willingness to learn - never too much
* [Unity Engine](https://unity.com) - free as long as you're poor or a student
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - for Unity C# scripts development (can use [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot/))
* {optional1} [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) - your terminal reimagined (does not need, or do not use tmux
* {optional2} [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org) - good terminal choice if you plan on using tmux
* {optional3} [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - another good terminal app
* {option} Get all that, it's free. Except GitHub Copilot, which cost 10$ a month, but is a good support AI code generation tool (work in Neovim and VS Code)
