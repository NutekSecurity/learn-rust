# Introduction to configuration step

Yet again, we will be preparing for the next chapters. And yet again I'm amazed by the lack of basic features in game engines, such as webview. Of course, I can pay 150$ or so for a full blown solution to get my _Unity Engine_ be pimped up, but I'm sorry, I don't have that much.

Unfortunetely I will have to give up on Ruby Domain Specific Language to build the whole storyline, but I think, we can keep this idea to at least maintain players inventory and statistics.
