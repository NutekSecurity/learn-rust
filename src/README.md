# Hej!

Learn programming in Rust by watching me making game server/engine for the gamebook, __Zew: Templars of Phoenix__.

___

What will be covered? Starting from configuring `Neovim` for `Rust` development (with debugger and intellisense) and a little bit of `tmux`, going to serving `gamebook` content and managing `inventory`, `save games`, `options `and `current game state`, everything connecting to `MongoDB` database. Creating custom made `Domain Specific Language` in `Ruby` for creating another gamebook content utilising existing resources in `Unity Engine`

Although this content is copyrighted and the actual game server/engine made here is live in production, and it's copying is strictly forbidden (treat it like a museum, _you can look, but you can't touch_) and a rightful owner is the author, _Szymon Bronisław Błaszczyński_, you're free to modificate source code to something else which is not similar, e.g., an RPG game, in nature to the game server/engine. In simple words, author asks not to blatantly copy and paste it to your own creation, but iterate and make something new in value and outcome, that you would be proud to show your mother, sister or a girlfriend. I just want to show you, curious one, how I made my backend for the Unity Engine frontend, in the thin client theme. Capisci?
